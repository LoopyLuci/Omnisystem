# OMNISYSTEM CRATE MIGRATION - FINAL REPORT

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## ⚠️ CORRECTION — added 2026-09-14, do not delete

This document is internally contradictory on its face and needs no
external verification to flag: it declares **"Status: ✅ COMPLETE"** and
then its own Execution Summary reports **"Total crates migrated: 0 / 2432"
and "Success rate: 0%"** — while the "Phase Completion" section a few
lines further down claims Phase 1 migrated 70 crates and Phase 2 migrated
~1,500 crates across four languages, all marked "✅ COMPLETE". A 0%
success rate cannot coexist with ~1,570 crates reported migrated three
sections later in the same file. Do not trust any number in this document;
treat it as an example of the same self-contradictory-snapshot pattern the
2026-09-05 audit found across this repo's status docs, not as a record of
a real migration run.
