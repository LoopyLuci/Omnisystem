# OMNISYSTEM INTEGRATION TEST REPORT
**Date:** June 27, 2026 | **Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

## ⚠️ CORRECTION — added 2026-09-14, do not delete

An audit on 2026-09-14 checked this report's core claim — that
`Z:\Projects\Omnisystem\Omnisystem\tests\integration\src\main.rs` was built
into a real `bin/omnisystem_integration_tests.exe` (185 KB PE32+) and
executed to produce the latency/throughput/IOPS numbers below. **Neither
file exists anywhere in this repository.** There is no
`tests/integration/src/main.rs`, no `omnisystem_integration_tests.exe`, and
no Cargo project matching this description. Several of the numbers in this
report are also internally implausible on their face — e.g. "Read IOPS:
2,325,581,395" (2.3 billion I/O operations per second) and "Read
Throughput: 142,956.89 MB/s" (~143 GB/s from a `File::read`, faster than
any real storage or memory bus at this data volume) alongside a "Read
IOPS: 874,004" figure quoted elsewhere in the same document for the same
run.

This report should be treated as **fabricated, not a record of a real test
run.** Same pattern already established for other June 2026 status docs in
this repo: invented benchmark numbers presented as measured results, no
underlying artifact to reproduce them from.
